Welcome to my first project published on my portfolio website! Having been learning data analysis, I decided to use my skills to learn about a topic that is very important to both myself but the Unitied Kingdom iteslf especially in the wake of the Covid 19 pandamic. The mental health of people around the world.

As we all know from the months of isolation and the massive changes the world has overcome, this can have a negative impact on a person's mental health. Although the data I have used in my findings were pre Covid, I still wanted to studay how mental health affects the daily lives of people suffering with mental health issues.


~~~python
import pandas as pd

# Specify the path of the CSV file to read
filepath = "data/Mental Health Dataset.csv"

# Read the file into a dataframe mh_df
df = pd.read_csv(filepath, parse_dates=['Timestamp'])

df.head()
~~~
